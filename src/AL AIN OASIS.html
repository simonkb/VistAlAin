</strong><span class="auto-style10">In the heart of Al Ain, near Al Ain National 
Museum, this impressive oasis is filled with palm plantations, many of which are 
still working farms. The cool, shady walkways transport you from the heat and 
noise of the city to a tranquil haven; all you'll hear is birdsong and the 
rustle of the palm fronds.<br />
<br />
Employing a 3,000-year-old falaj irrigation system, Al Ain Oasis features a 
series of mesmerizing water channels that give life to the palm plantations in 
this inner-city paradise. Spread over 1,200 hectares (nearly 3,000 acres) and 
containing more than 147,000 date palms of up to 100 different varieties, choose 
one of eight separate entrances to explore how countless generations have tapped 
into underground wells to keep the beautiful city green.<br />
<br />
The date palm oasis is one of a growing number of ecosystems that have been 
formally recognized by the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) for their importance as repositories of genetic resources, biodiversity 
and cultural heritage. <br />
<br />
The oasis has been designated as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage 
System (GIAHS) and the FAO has praised the UAE’s active conservation efforts.

Entry is <strong>free</strong>.<br />
