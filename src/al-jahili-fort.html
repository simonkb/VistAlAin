<p class="auto-style2" style="height: 528px"><span class="auto-style8">The 
picturesque Al Jahili Fort is one of the UAE’s most historic buildings. It was 
erected in 1891 to defend the city and protect precious palm groves. The former 
headquarters of the Oman Trucial Scouts, the force that protected the mountain 
passes and kept inter-tribal peace, it also served as a residence for the local 
governor. It is set in beautifully landscaped gardens, and visitors are 
encouraged to explore it.</span><br class="auto-style8" />
<br class="auto-style8" />
<span class="auto-style8">An Al Ain landmark, the fort has been carefully 
restored and now houses a permanent exhibition of the work of British adventurer 
Sir Wilfred Thesiger (whom the locals affectionately refer to as ‘Mubarak Bin 
London’) and his 1940s crossings of the Rub Al Khali (The Empty Quarter) desert.</span><br class="auto-style8" />
