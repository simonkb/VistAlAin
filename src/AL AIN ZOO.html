</strong><span class="auto-style10">This 900 hectare park near the base of Jebel 
Hafeet is where visitors can see a large animal collection in enclosures that 
closely resemble their natural habitats. There are plenty of green public spaces 
for picnics and also playgrounds, a cafeteria and a train tour of the wildlife 
area.<br />
<br />
The Al Ain Zoo is home to over 4,000 animals, with at least 30% of its 180 
species considered endangered. Conservation efforts have been strengthened by 
partnerships with San Diego Zoo, the Fairchild Tropical Botanical Garden in 
Miami, and the World Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums. <br />
<br />
Giraffe feeding, camel riding and ‘Elezba’ petting zoo are the latest 
interactive activities. Visitors can enjoy feeding the giraffe treats such as 
carrots or lettuce five times daily in a special area. Designed in the style of 
a local farm, the ‘Elezba’ petting zoo lets families feed and play with sheep, 
goats, camels, llamas, chicken and ducks, enjoy camel riding or picnic in a 
designated area.<br />
<br />
The general opening hours for the zoo are from 9am to 8pm, however during the 
hot summer months (June-September), the facility operates from 4pm-10pm. For

Children’s Garden<br />
<br />
</strong>A fun-filled, outdoor learning scheme designed to inspire children with 
a love for biodiversity, this garden demonstrates the beauty of plants. The 
garden features a rolling hill, mixed use play areas, picnic spots, a flower 
garden and native plant garden with species indigenous to the UAE, a recycling 
garden and a vegetable, fruit and herb garden. With spectacular African Baobab 
trees framing the area, the towering trunks offer a genuine horticulture lesson 
in how specific plants can adapt to dry soil conditions.<br />
