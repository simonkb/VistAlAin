</strong><span class="auto-style10">Rising 1,240 meters, Jebel Hafeet is the 
emirate’s highest peak, and UAE’s second. This towering rocky height, which 
stands guard over Al Ain and borders Oman, is forged out of craggy limestone 
that has been weathered over millions of years. Significant fossil discoveries 
have been made in the area, which are vital pieces in the jigsaw of the city’s 
ancient history.<br />
<br />
Over 500 ancient burial tombs dating back 5,000 years have been found in the 
Jebel Hafeet foothills. <br />
<br />
You can drive or, if you have the stamina, cycle to the top via a winding 
highway, which <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/">edmunds.com</a> (the 
automotive information online source) describes as “among the world’s greatest 
driving roads.” Once you reach the top, you'll be rewarded with magnificent 
views over Al Ain, where you can take a break at the Mercure Jebel Hafeet hotel 
near the Jebel’s peak.<br />
