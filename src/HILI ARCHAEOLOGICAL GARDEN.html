</strong><span class="auto-style10">Just 10 kilometers outside Al Ain (on the 
road to Dubai) are the Hili Archaeological Gardens.</span><br class="auto-style10" />
<br class="auto-style10" />
<span class="auto-style10">Combining both a public garden and the archaeological 
site, this is a popular place for tourists and residents alike. The 
archaeological site has remnants of a Bronze Age settlement (2,500-2,000 BC), 
which was excavated and restored in 1995. It is the source of some of the 
richest finds in the area, many of which are believed to be over 4,000 years 
old.</span><br class="auto-style10" />
<br class="auto-style10" />
<span class="auto-style10">There are other archaeological structures around the 
park, but it is chiefly a garden with plants, fountains, and a small children's 
play area. Hili is near Fossil Valley, an area rich in a variety of fossils 
dating back many thousands of years to when it was covered by sea.</span><br class="auto-style10" />
