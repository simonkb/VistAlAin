</strong><span class="auto-style10">This is the last souk of its kind in the 
UAE, east of Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain is an excellent opportunity to see camels up 
close, and to see and hear traders discussing the price and merits of their 
animals. There are some excellent photo opportunities, but be careful where you 
point your lens and always ask permission first.</span><br class="auto-style10" />

<span class="auto-style10">People will try to sell you a tour around the pens, 
but feel free to walk around on your own. In the livestock section, watch locals 
arrive in pickups laden with goats and sheep, ready to do some hard bargaining.</span><br class="auto-style10" />
